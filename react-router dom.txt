✅ React is mainly used to create Single Page Applications (SPAs).
✅ If you want multiple "pages" inside App.jsx without reloading the page, you use react-router-dom.
✅ React Router allows dynamic URL changes while keeping the app a SPA.

How react-router-dom Works in a SPA
Without react-router-dom

React loads everything in a single component (like App.jsx).

Clicking a link just changes the UI without changing the URL.

The user feels stuck on one page.

With react-router-dom

The app still stays a SPA (no full-page reload).

URLs update dynamically (e.g., /home, /about).

Different components load based on the URL path.

The browser's Back & Forward buttons work correctly.
